title: Provenance
layout: standard
hero_text: To trace software back to the source and define the moving parts in a complex supply chain, provenance needs to be there from the very beginning. Itâ€™s the verifiable information about software artifacts describing where, when and how something was produced. For higher SLSA levels and more resilient integrity guarantees, provenance requirements are stricter and need a deeper, more technical understanding of the predicate.
---

<div class="mt-16 mb-4">

## Purpose

</div>

Describe how an artifact or set of artifacts was produced so that:

1.  Consumers of the provenance can verify that the artifact was built according
    to expectations.
2.  Others can rebuild the artifact, if desired.

This predicate is the recommended way to satisfy the SLSA [provenance
requirements].

<div class="mt-16 mb-4">

## Prerequisite

</div>

Understanding of SLSA [Software Attestations](/attestation-model)
and the larger [in-toto attestation] framework.

<div class="mt-16 mb-4">

## Model

</div>

Provenance is an attestation that some entity (`builder`) produced one or more
software artifacts (the `subject` of an in-toto attestation [Statement]) by
executing some `invocation`, using some other artifacts as input (`materials`).
The invocation in turn runs the `buildConfig`, which is a record of what was
executed. The builder is trusted to have faithfully recorded the provenance;
there is no option but to trust the builder. However, the builder may have
performed this operation at the request of some external, possibly untrusted
entity. These untrusted parameters are captured in the invocation's `parameters`
and some of the `materials`. Finally, the build may have depended on various
environmental parameters (`environment`) that are needed for
[reproducing][reproducible] the build but that are not under external control.

See [Example](#example) for a concrete example.

## Schema

</div>

```jsonc
{
    // Standard attestation fields:
    "_type": "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v0.1",
    "subject": [{ /*...*/ }],

    // Predicate:
    "predicateType": "https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1.0",

### Parsing rules

</div>

This predicate follows the in-toto attestation [parsing rules]. Summary:

-   Consumers MUST ignore unrecognized fields.
-   The `predicateType` URI includes the major version number and will always
    change whenever there is a backwards incompatible change.
-   Minor version changes are always backwards compatible and "monotonic." Such
    changes do not update the `predicateType`.
-   Producers MAY add extension fields using field names that are URIs.
-   Optional fields MAY be unset or null, and should be treated equivalently.
    Both are equivalent to empty for _object_ or _array_ values.

<div class="mt-8 mb-4">

### Fields

</div>

_NOTE: This section describes the fields within `predicate`. For a description
of the other top-level fields, such as `subject`, see [Statement]._

### buildDefinition

#### buildDefinition.configSource

##### buildDefinition.configSource.uri

##### buildDefinition.configSource.uri

### instanceMetadata

## Example

</div>

WARNING: This is just for demonstration purposes.

Suppose the builder downloaded `example-1.2.3.tar.gz`, extracted it, and ran
`make -C src foo CFLAGS=-O3`, resulting in a file with hash `5678...`. Then the
provenance might look like this:

```jsonc
{
  "_type": "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v0.1",
  // Output file; name is "_" to indicate "not important".
  "subject": [{"name": "_", "digest": {"sha256": "5678..."}}],
  "predicateType": "https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1.0",
  "predicate": {
    "buildType": "https://example.com/Makefile",
    "builder": { "id": "mailto:person@example.com" },
    "invocation": {
      "configSource": {
        "uri": "https://example.com/example-1.2.3.tar.gz",
        "digest": {"sha256": "1234..."},
        "entryPoint": "src:foo",                // target "foo" in directory "src"
      },
      "parameters": {"CFLAGS": "-O3"}           // extra args to `make`
    },
    "materials": [{
      "uri": "https://example.com/example-1.2.3.tar.gz",
      "digest": {"sha256": "1234..."}

### GitHub Actions

</div>

WARNING: This is only for demonstration purposes. The GitHub Actions team has
not yet reviewed or approved this design, and it is not yet implemented. Details
are subject to change!

If GitHub is the one to generate provenance, and the runner is GitHub-hosted,
then the builder would be as follows:

```json
"builder": {
  "id": "https://github.com/Attestations/GitHubHostedActions@v1"
}

Self-hosted runner: Not yet supported. We need to figure out a URI scheme that
represents what system hosted the runner, or perhaps add additional properties
in `builder`.

WARNING: This is just a proof-of-concept. It is not yet standardized.

Execution of arbitrary commands:

// There was no entry point, and the commands were run in an ad-hoc fashion.
// There is no `configSource`.
"invocation": null,
"buildConfig": {

## Change history

</div>

-   0.2: Refactored to aid clarity and added `buildConfig`. The model is
    unchanged.
    -   Replaced `definedInMaterial` and `entryPoint` with `configSource`.
    -   Renamed `recipe` to `invocation`.
    -   Moved `invocation.type` to top-level `buildType`.
    -   Renamed `arguments` to `parameters`.
    -   Added `buildConfig`, which can be used as an alternative to
        `configSource` to validate the configuration.
-   Renamed to "slsa.dev/provenance".
-   0.1.1: Added `metadata.buildInvocationId`.
-   0.1: Initial version, named "in-toto.io/Provenance"
